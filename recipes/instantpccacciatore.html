<h3>The Instant Pot Chicken Cacciatore one of a kind</h3>
<p>Italian Instant Pot Chicken Cacciatore is a savory and flavorful <br> dish that combines the rustic flavors of Italy with the convenience <br>of modern cooking technology.</p>
<p>This classic recipe typically features tender chicken pieces simmered<br> in a rich tomato sauce, complemented by a medley of bell peppers,<br> onions, and aromatic herbs.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
   <li>4 (6 ounce) bone-in chicken thighs, with skin</li>
   <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
   <li>1 (4 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
   <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
   <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
   <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
   <li>1 (14 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
   <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
   <li>2 teaspoons herbes de Provence</li>
   <li>¾ cup water</li>
   <li>3 cubes chicken bouillon, crumbled</li>
   <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
   <li>1 pinch ground black pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Rinse chicken thighs and pat dry with paper towels. Heat oil in the pot of an<br> electric pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) on Sauté mode; add chicken. Cook<br> until browned, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate, reserving<br> drippings in the pot.</li>
    
    <li>Place mushrooms, celery, and onion in the pot; cook and stir until soft, about 5<br> minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Place chicken back in<br> the pot; add tomatoes and tomato paste. Sprinkle with herbes de Provence. Top<br> with water and bouillon.</li>
    
    <li>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's<br> instructions. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. Cook for 11 minutes.</li>
    
    <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to<br> manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid carefully,<br> turning it away from you. Test chicken for doneness; an instant-read thermometer<br> inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Season to taste<br> with red pepper flakes and black pepper.</li>
