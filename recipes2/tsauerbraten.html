<h3>Sauerbraten is a German roast of marinated meat, traditionally beef.</h3>
<p>Traditional Sauerbraten is a classic German pot roast dish that has been enjoyed for centuries.<br> The name "Sauerbraten" translates to "sour roast," which accurately reflects the unique<br> preparation method.</p>
<p>Typically made with beef (though other meats like lamb, pork, or even poultry can be used),<br> the dish involves marinating the meat in a mixture of vinegar, water, and spices for several days.</p>
